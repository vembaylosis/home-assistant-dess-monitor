"""Coulomb-counting State-of-Charge estimator for inverters without a BMS.

Some firmwares don't expose a battery percentage at all, or expose only a
load-percent value mislabelled as SOC. When the user knows their bank's
nominal capacity (Ah) and full-charge voltage, we can integrate the signed
battery current over time to track SOC accurately enough for energy-flow
visualisation.

Algorithm — per device, per coordinator update:

1. Take signed battery current ``I`` (positive = charging, negative =
   discharging) and battery terminal voltage ``V``.
2. Coulomb integration: ``ΔAh = I · Δt``; ``ΔSOC% = ΔAh / capacity_Ah · 100``.
   Apply to the running SOC, clamped to ``[0, 100]``.
3. Voltage-based rebase at full: when ``V`` is at-or-above the configured
   full-charge voltage AND ``|I|`` falls below ``BATTERY_FULL_TAIL_CURRENT_RATIO``
   of the bank capacity (i.e. we're in the absorption tail), pin SOC = 100%.
   This is the only "anchor" we have without an empty-rebase event, so it's
   essential for long-term drift correction.
4. Persist SOC + last-update timestamp through HA restarts so a brief restart
   doesn't reset the estimate to None.

Caveats and intentional simplifications:

- No empty-rebase: discharge cutoff is firmware-controlled, so by the time
  we'd "see" empty the inverter has typically already shut down.
- No temperature compensation: most users don't expose battery temperature.
- Chemistry argument is recorded for forward compatibility but currently has
  no effect on the math — voltage rebase uses only the user-provided
  ``voltage_full``, which already encodes the chemistry-specific absorb
  level.
- First-ever boot: SOC starts at None until at least one coulomb tick can
  compute a delta against a saved or seeded value. We don't try to seed
  from voltage alone — the resting OCV curve is too device-specific and a
  bad seed would be worse than ``Unknown`` until the user takes the bank
  through one full charge.
